# New-Colorful-Splendida-256-firmware-
This new Fall 2021 firmware fo Splendida 256 by WOKWI with new and most colorful effects.

This sketch use one button to control patterns and bright. And esp32 M5 Atom lite with builtin button is ideal for this sketch (yes, i use Atom lite)

Controls: 

Firm start with Automode ON and if button not press patterns change in loop. If one click buttons Automode is OFF and you can cnange next pattern by one click button.

if button is double clicked bright is change in loop from 0 to max bright with 7 steps (i think this is best method to control bright). Double click not affect to Automode state.

If button is longpressed Automode id ON and patterns patterns change in loop because button not press.

This is second version of my demoreel for Splendida. Now effects is most colorful with blend palletes. 

Sketch used two libraries: FastLED https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED and OneButton https://github.com/mathertel/OneButton
